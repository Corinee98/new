                <p>In human anatomy, the arm refers to the upper limb in common usage, although academically the term specifically means the upper arm[1][2] between the glenohumeral joint (shoulder joint) and the elbow joint. The distal part of the upper limb between the elbow and the radiocarpal joint (wrist joint) is known as the forearm or "lower" arm, and the extremity beyond the wrist is the hand.</p>
            <li>2.Chest</li>

                <p>The thorax (pl.: thoraces or thoraxes)[1] or chest is a part of the anatomy of mammals and other tetrapod animals located between the neck and the abdomen.[2][3] In insects, crustaceans, and the extinct trilobites, the thorax is one of the three main divisions of the creature's body, each of which is in turn composed of multiple segments.</p>
            <li>3.Belly</li>
                <br><img src="human belly image.jpg" width="300px" height="300px">
                <p>The abdomen (colloquially called the belly, tummy, midriff, tucky[citation needed] or stomach) is the part of the body between the thorax (chest) and pelvis, in humans and in other vertebrates. The abdomen is the front part of the abdominal segment of the torso. The area occupied by the abdomen is called the abdominal cavity. In arthropods, it is the posterior tagma of the body; it follows the thorax or cephalothorax.[1]</p>
