                <p>An eye is a sensory organ that allows an organism to perceive visual information. It detects light and converts it into electro-chemical impulses in neurons (neurones). It is part of an organism's visual system.</p>
            <li>2.Nose</li>
                <br><img src="human nose image.jpg" width="300px" height="300px">
                <p>A nose is a protuberance in vertebrates that houses the nostrils, or nares, which receive and expel air for respiration alongside the mouth. Behind the nose are the olfactory mucosa and the sinuses. Behind the nasal cavity, air next passes through the pharynx, shared with the digestive system, and then into the rest of the respiratory system. In humans, the nose is located centrally on the face and serves as an alternative respiratory passage especially during suckling for infants.[1][2][3] The protruding nose that is completely separate from the mouth part is a characteristic found only in therian mammals. It has been theorized that this unique mammalian nose evolved from the anterior part of the upper jaw of the reptilian-like ancestors (synapsids).[4][5]</p>
            <li>3.Lips</li>
                <br><img src="human libs image.jpg" width="300px" height="300px">
                <p>The lips are a horizontal pair of soft appendages attached to the jaws and are the most visible part of the mouth of many animals, including humans.[1] Vertebrate lips are soft, movable and serve to facilitate the ingestion of food (e.g. suckling and gulping) and the articulation of sound and speech. Human lips are also a somatosensory organ, and can be an erogenous zone when used in kissing and other acts of intimacy.</p>
